SMACCO - SMart ACcount COmposer

This project aims to easily generate "smart accounts" for holding assets based on different (and combined) logic:
- public/private key validation
- MultiSig
- timelock
- Asset-specific behavior (only allowing withdraws for specific assets, for example)

That will help NEO users to easily create and manage safe account addresses. Initially, only json interface will be provided to allow C# code generation (that will become AVM). After that, visual interfaces can help the design process, keeping in mind this is not a tool intended for developers, but to general public.
